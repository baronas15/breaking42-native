DO LATER:

Big picture vision:
- Gather data in forms of questions and set target
  SCREENS:

  1. What is your goal
  I want to run first race (Extra question: Target goal 5K, 10K, 21K, 42K)
  I want to improve PB (Disabled now, coming soon)

  2. What's your overall activity level?
  5K, 10K, half marathon or marathon time in the last month or two
  OR
  What's your average pace

  3. How many workouts a week can you have
  3 4 5 6
  (No marathon if only 3, no 6 for beginner)

  4. Have you set a race day? (Optional)

  {
    target: {
      first: true,
      distance: number (42)
    }
    recentPace: ?
    weeklyWorkouts: number
    race?: { year, month, day }
  }

- Take existing data about the user
- Measure required time (24 weeks first marathon, 16 for half, 12 for 10K)
- Set up first week
- Set up hardest week (2-3 weeks before finish)
  hardest workouts should include a long run (e.g. 20 miles), a tempo run (e.g. 5 miles at half marathon race pace), and a set of high-intensity intervals (e.g. 5 x 1,000 meters at 5K race pace). One of these three runs should be more challenging than the other two. If you're training for a 5K, the high-intensity interval workout should be the toughest. If you're training for a 10K or half marathon, emphasize the tempo run. And if it's a marathon you're preparing for, test yourself most on the long runs.
- Using 10% rule and 4th week as recovery fill in the rest of the weeks
-   Speed run and long runs are essential
-   2-3 Hard workouts can be done in a week
-   Take at least one easy day after every hard day of training
-   long run can consist of up to 50% of the runners mileage
-   10% rule (increase mileage no more than 10% of the last week)
-   Race recovery rule (Applies when race was all out. For each mile that you race, allow one day of recovery before returning to hard training or racing)
-   Run at least 20 miler before marathon
-   Make every third or fourth week a recovery week, where running mileage is reduced by 20 to 30 percent from the week before
-   Select a Weekly Workout Template
