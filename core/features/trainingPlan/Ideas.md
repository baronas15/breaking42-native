Rules for running:
  Goal scheduling
    - 10% rule (increase mileage no more than 10% of the last week)
    - Race recovery rule (Applies when race was all out. For each mile that you race, allow one day of recovery before returning to hard training or racing)
    - Run at least 20 miler before marathon
    - Take at least one easy day after every hard day of training
    - Easy week every month (rest week, long run is shorter, weekly mileage is lower)

  Tracking: (Mostly vocal instructions if going too fast or too slow)
    - 10 minute warm up
    - Should be able to talk while running (as an instruction)
    - Galloway says you should run even slower on hot days
    - The longer the race, the slower your pace.
    - The most effective pace for VO2 max interval training is about 20 seconds faster per mile than your 5 K race pace.
    - Lactate-threshold or tempo-run pace is about the pace you can maintain when running all-out for one hour.

- 2 hour rule (wait for 2 hours after meal to start training)
- Do your longest training runs at least three minutes per mile slower than your 5K race pace.
- Lots of carbs on marathon week
- New shoes after 400-500 miles (or even 300-400km)
