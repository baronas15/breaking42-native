DO LATER:

Long run – Much like an easy run, this is a long, slow distance run that will build your endurance. Run at an easy pace; you should be able to hold a conversation. This should be 30 seconds to one minute per mile slower than your goal pace.

Mile repeats – After a one-mile warm-up, run one mile at the given pace, then jog very slowly for half a mile to recover. Repeat cycles as directed. Cool down with one mile of easy running.

Marathon pace – This is the pace that you hope to maintain in the race. Run one mile easy to warm up and one mile easy to cool down.

Easy – Easy runs should be done 30 seconds to one minute per mile slower than your marathon goal pace.

Rest/Cross-Train (XT) – Take a rest day, or do moderate cross-training with a no-impact activity such as yoga or swimming.

Tempo – Run easy for one mile to warm up. Then ease into the given pace for the distance show. Run easy for a mile to cool down. Tempo runs should feel challenging; on a scale of one to 10, your effort will feel like a seven or eight. You should be able to utter just a few words at a time. These runs train your body to sustain speed over distance.


SPEED RUNS
Building strength through speed training is important as you prepare. Throughout
this plan you’ll be introduced to a variety of speed workouts and drills that will
make you faster. You’ll get to do short and long intervals, fartlek, hill workouts and
tempo runs. (See Types of Runs in the Glossary for definitions of these).

LONG RUNS
You need endurance training to help prepare your body and mind to go the distance
on race day. You will work on endurance and pacing with weekly Long Runs. It also
helps you get familiar with the physical and mental challenges that you might face
during a race. This run should be run at a comfortable pace, and as a Progression
Run (See Types of Runs in the Glossary for definition of Progression Run).

RECOVERY RUNS
Recovering from your workout days is just as important as the workouts
themselves. Use these days to run easy and based on how you feel to help you
recover at the highest quality possible after intense training. Each week of training
includes two recovery runs. Recovery Runs are just as important as your hard workouts.

REST DAYS
Great running is dependent on great rest and recovery. These days are meant for
you to recharge and recover. Either take the day off, try one of the workouts from
“Simple Routines For Better Runs” in the NTC App or go for a few easy miles or
kilometers. It is essential that you talk to and listen to your body as you progress
through the training program. Sometimes you will need to adjust the program to fit
what you need. And yes, that means that sometimes the best speed run or long run
will be no run. 


PROGRESSION RUN
Progression Runs improve stamina and allow the body to adapt to the stress
of running. Build your pace over the course of each run by starting at a slower
than Recovery Run pace and finishing at a faster than Recovery Run pace.
Over the course of the run you will average your Recovery Run pace. This
progression from the slowest running of the run to the fastest running of the run
allows your body to ease into the run and adjust to the activity of running in a
natural way. Your Long and Recovery Runs should be run as Progression Runs.

INTERVALS
Intervals refer to a Speed Run session that includes a set of running and rest
intervals. There are any number of variations one could use when doing an
interval Speed Run. The distance or duration as well as the pace and effort of the
running interval can remain the same or change over the course of the workout.
The recovery interval duration is another element of the Speed Run that can
remain static or change during the workout. Ideally a session like this takes place
on a track but does not need to. Any location that allows you to run freely is
suitable for an interval-based Speed Run.

FARTLEK
Fartlek is loosely translated from Swedish to “speed play”. Fartlek works on
speed and strength by alternating distances and paces during a continuous
run. An example Fartlek workout structure could be one-minute running easy
followed by one-minute running hard, repeated for a certain amount of minutes,
miles or alternating every city block.

HILLS
Hill workouts develop speed and form. It takes extra effort to run uphill so you
do not need to run as fast as you would on a flat section. While running uphill,
remain in control of your breathing. Don’t lean too far forward. A light lean with
the chin leading the chest is enough. Running up hills is a great way to develop
speed and strength with minimal pounding on the legs. It’s best to use effort as
a guide rather than pace when doing a hill workout.

TEMPO RUN
A Tempo Run is a hard but controlled pace that can be run as long intervals or
a steady run of 1-10 miles. The purpose of a Tempo Run is to build mental and
physical endurance and to become comfortable with being uncomfortable.
